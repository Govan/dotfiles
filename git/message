# Write capitalized summary of less than 50 chars using the imperative. 
# The summary should read # as a continutation of: 
# "If applied, this commit will..." (e.g.)
# "Update getting started documentation"
# "Remove references to older api" 
#
#------- Your summary should be this wide --------#


# Blank link and then detailed explanatory text, if necessary.  Write
# your commit message in the imperative: "Fix bug" and not "Fixed bug"
# or "Fixes bug."   This convention matches up with commit messages
# generated by commands like git merge and git revert.
